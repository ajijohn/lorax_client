Project Lorax

The goal of this project is to create an automated sensor for detecting moisture levels in plant soil. When the app is finished, the sensors will send data to a service layer app to be read and analyzed. If the readings are below a certain level, the plant will tweet at its owner(via twitter api) to water it. On the client side, we will create a dashboard and hub so plant owners using our device can join and add plants, tweet at each other and check out the stats of other users plants.
